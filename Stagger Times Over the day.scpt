	# DESCRIPTION #

	Stagger Times does the same thing as Stagger Dates, but for a single day. It takes the selected tasks and reschedules each task to start at the end of the previous task based on the previous due time and the estimated time of the task.

This lets me throw everything to a single day (which will use the default due time) and then spread them out throughout the day. If the tasks go too late, I know Iâ€™ve bit off more than I can chew for that day.

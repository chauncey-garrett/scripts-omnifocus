	# DESCRIPTION #
	
	Stagger Dates takes the selected tasks and redistributes them one weekday at a time. For example, if it is Monday and you select 5 tasks and hit Stagger Dates, you’ll have one task on each day of the week. If it is Tuesday, then you’ll have 4 for this week and 1 on next Monday.

I use this when I plan a sequence of tasks (like all these blog posts) and want to only do one a day. I also use in when after a big reorg I have a ton of tasks on a single day. This quickly balances out tasks without having to edit them all by hand.

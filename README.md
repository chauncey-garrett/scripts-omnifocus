## Scripts for OmniFocus 2

A curated collection of scripts (including AppleScripts) that I have either made and/or commandeered for OmniFocus 2.

## Installation

Fork the repository and do like so:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/chauncey-garrett/scripts-omnifocus.git "$HOME/Library/Application Scripts/com.omnigroup.OmniFocus2"
```

If you plan on contributing back to the repository, add the following to `.git/config` **before making any commits.** This code will ensure that the AppleScripts are viewable under version control by decompiling them to plain text before updating the repository.

```sh
[filter "ascr"]
	clean = "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"/git-ascr-filter.sh --clean %f
	smudge = "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"/git-ascr-filter.sh --smudge %f"
```

If you have feature suggestions, please open an [issue](https://github.com/chauncey-garrett/scripts-sonos/issues "chauncey-garrett/scripts-sonos/issues"). If you have contributions, open a [pull request](https://github.com/chauncey-garrett/scripts-sonos/pull-request "chauncey-garrett/scripts-sonos/pulls"). I'd love to expand this library as much as is possible.

## Author(s)

Note that there are some scripts here that I did NOT make and have only curated within this repository. If you found a particular script useful that I did not author, please send your support to that particular person. To the best of my ability, appropriate licensing and authorship information is provided for those scripts which I have not written.

*The author(s) of this module should be contacted via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/chauncey-garrett/scripts-sonos/issues "chauncey-garrett/scripts-sonos/issues").*
